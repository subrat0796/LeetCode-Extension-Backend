# Yeah you can steal the code if you want. If you find any difficulties please contact subratsahoo0796@gmail.com

# Setup the Project Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subrat0796/LeetCode-Extension-Backend.git
cd ./LeetCode-Extension-Backend && npm i
cp .env.example .env
```

Now you are ready for running the project locally

# Todo

1. Complete the whole setup
2. Think of optimizations
3. Adding docker
4. Writing tests
5. Running scripts in the start of the project so that the questions are downloaded automatically without hitting the route
6. Configuring husky for pre-commit and having a proper code format
7. Maybe add Google Signin features
8. Keep on thinking about what extra features could be added ?
